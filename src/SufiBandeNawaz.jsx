                P.P. Haji-Sheikh Moinuddin Chisti more popularly known as Khwaja
                Garib Nawaz, and Ajmer Sharif (the benefactor of the poor).

                He was one of the most important of the five vibhutis to
                contribute his powerful guidance to Dada in this almighty's
                mission. He was originally known as Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti,
                born in Iran in a village called "Sistan" and was brought up in
                "Khorasan". He was a direct descendant of Prophet Hazrat
                Muhammad Paigambar's ancestry, meaning they belonged to the same
                family tree, and P.P Muhammad Jilani was Moinuddin's maternal
                uncle, i.e. mamaji. Right from his childhood, he got immense
                happiness in helping poor people and giving food donations. He
                was a symbol of love, harmony and peace. He spent his entire
                life preaching love for all living beings and communal harmony.
                He saw the same fire burning in Dada to help humanity and
                therefore jumped to help him in this mission.

                Khwaja Garib Nawaz's family was wealthy, but he lost his mother
                when he was just eight years old and lost his father when 15
                years old. He was left with a small portion of land in the
                distribution of his family property. He sold his property and
                donated all his wealth to the poor and searched for spiritual
                knowledge. Later he received Guruagnya (instructions from his
                guru) to set up his mission and continue preaching in India in
                Ajmer. He took a deep interest in Iterejan Runanubandh and how
                he can help erase the pains and miseries that affected his
                devotee's lives.
                <strong>
                  This is why in Gurumarg, Khwaja Garib Nawaz took the
                  responsibility of correcting the problems relating to Iterejan
                  for all the devotees (BhaktBhavikas).
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                During his guidance to Dada in this mission, he instructed Dada
                to visit Pant Maharaj Balekundri. This very instruction proved
                so fruitful for Dada. During his visit to Kshetra Balekundri, he
                followed every order and instruction directed by Pant Maharaj
                himself and quickly attained the divine Shabdbrahma and
                Naadbrahma. With this enlightenment, P.P.Dada was able to give
                unique tunes and melody to all the aartis written by Pant
                Maharaj in "Shri Duttapremlehari". P.P. Khwaja Garib Nawaz
                always knew that music is the most powerful medium to connect to
                the almighty. With Shri SaiBaba's and Khwaja Garib Nawaz's
                guidance and under Pant Maharaj's instructions, Dada achieved a
                massive part in the success of this mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a combined desire of all the Vibhutis that Dada must have
                his own Vastu (a sacred place) for this mission. They had even
                decided the name "Dwarka Mai" and had expressed their wish
                during their several Mulakhats (appearances) through Dada's
                medium. But Dada's health was deteriorating, and without
                monetary help, this would not have been possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a unique custom to put a shawl over Dada's shoulder
                whenever Ajmer Sharif Baba came into Sanchar Avastha through
                Dada's medium. During one of such Mulakhat by Khwaja Moinuddin
                Chisti, he explained the importance of raising this Vastu. He
                spread his shawl in front of all the devotees and made a humble
                request for monetary aid, a loan to help build "Dwarka Mai".
                Baba even further assured to return the borrowed money to all
                the devotees. With this donation and all of the Vibhuti's
                guidance; The Holy temple of Dwarka Mai was raised. Even after
                this construction, there was no end to difficulties faced by
                Dada and the Vibhutis. They had a difficult time in availing the
                completion certificate from the municipality. Khawja Garib Nawaz
                appeared in Sanchar Avastha, and the devotees placed the shawl
                over Dada's shoulder. The municipality registration was cleared
                in no time. What is more surprising is that through all these
                difficult times, Dada was even able to return all the borrowed
                money back to the devotees as promised. Furthermore, these
                devotees who had extended their help with a donation for this
                Vastu were blessed by Khwaja Garib Nawaz himself to have their
                own Vastu (home) today. Only Khwaja Saheb himself had this great
                Ashirwad (blessing) for all Vastus â€“ this was his specialty.
                This is why Dada always considered "DwarkaMai" as the property
                of the Vibhutis and not his own.
              </p>
              <p>
                In every Mulakhat that Khwaja Garib Nawaz appeared in, his kind
                words and strong love for his devotees flowed like sweet nectar.
                His eagerness and passion for helping all the needy and poor
                were beyond limits. Conclusively, this is how Khwaja Garib Nawaz
                played a critical role in Gurumarg.

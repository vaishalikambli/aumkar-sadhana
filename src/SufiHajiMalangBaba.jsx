              <p>
                Out of the five peers (Sufis) who guided Shri Dada to establish
                this Gurumarg for the benefit of mankind, Shri Haji Malang Baba
                was the leader in this mission. He spent his whole life serving
                humanity through his divine motivation and influence. Enough
                information on all the other Sufi Vibhutis was able to be
                collected except for Shri Haji Malang Baba. All the data
                collected about him was taken from narrated stories. Every time
                Haji Malang Baba came in Sanchar avastha through Dada's medium,
                he emitted absolute unconditional love that reached everyone's
                heart. This is why at the mention of Shri Haji Malang Baba, he
                emerges in oneâ€™s mind as a powerful heavenly being rather than a
                divine-human being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Malang Baba's Darga is situated on top of a hill named Malang
                Gad, near Kalyan. This piece of land was the diskha Bhoomi of
                the Nathas. Usually, there are three religious processions or
                pilgrimages that take place here. The first Utsav is on Diwali
                Padwa, second is the main Utsav on Magh Shudh Purnima, and the
                third Utsav is on Falguni Purnima day. As promised to Muhamad
                Pegambar, even today Shri Haji Malang Baba continues his mission
                of manavta dharma and swadharma through a different religious
                appearance from the land of Naath Prabhu. Shri Haji Malang Baba,
                the name itself, has the essence of divine inspiration, where
                Haji means the one who has completed his '
                <strong>
                  <em>Haj </em>
                </strong>
                ' pilgrimage to Mecca-Medina and '
                <strong>
                  <em>Malang </em>
                </strong>
                ' means Brahmachari, or it also means '
                <strong>
                  <em>Malay ang </em>
                </strong>
                ' whose whole body smells like Sandalwood (Chandan).
              </p>
              <p>
                Haji Malang Baba had attained this divine power by strictly
                following religious conduct. Later, according to Almighty's
                wish, Haji Malang Baba carried out the mission to undertake
                manavta dharma and help mankind through Shri Dada's medium. In
                this mission, Baba disregarded every aspect of religion, caste,
                sub-caste, and gender; overlooked the differences between rich
                and poor, old and young, while serving the people and blending
                totally with the almighty. This is why the meaning of the
                worldly name '
                <strong>
                  <em>Haji </em>
                </strong>
                ' is now perceived as a Vibhuti who is wholly integrated with
                the divine power as one.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name Malang (Brahmachari) is so appropriate because Brahma
                Gyan (Universal knowledge) is encompassed all around his
                presence, surrounding him with a heavenly glow. He generously
                fed his devotees Brahma Gyan with great love, just like how a
                mother feeds her child. Just like how sandalwood fragrance is
                spread by rubbing gently on the stone, Haji Baba's selfless,
                generous acts are emanated with divine love. The word Baba in
                Haji Malang Baba refers to parental love (matrupitru prem) and
                duties (kartavya). Baba's love and kindness are compared to that
                of the{" "}
                <strong>
                  <em>Kshirsagar</em>
                </strong>{" "}
                and are described through the hymn 'Malangbaba Premsagara'. Shri
                Dada himself was also very affectionate, and when Haji Malang
                Baba came in Sanchar avastha through Shri Dada's medium, the
                divine love used to overflow and touch the hearts of all the
                devotees. This divinity had such a strong emotional effect on
                all the devotees that they were left in a state of awe.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you go for Haji Baba's darshan, different insights and
                awareness are presented by Baba through the surroundings
                mediums. During the climb up the hill, hundreds of scroungers
                are seen begging for food. Haji Baba makes us aware that despite
                living in the proximity of the almighty, if one continues to
                live with a perception that this life is due to our past karma,
                then pain and suffering will never leave you. Baba explained
                that when you bow down and touch your forehead to his Mazar, do
                not fall prey to karma but come forth with real dharma. Live for
                others rather than live for your own self. Instead of making a
                prayer for oneself, make a prayer for the welfare of mankind and
                encourage humanity as a whole. After a tedious climb, when
                devotees reach the dargah and touch their forehead to Baba's
                mazaar, they feel a surge of contentment and happiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every night there is 'Khidmat' ritual in Haji Baba's dargah.
                This is a ritual of removing and clearing away of the offered
                flowers and spreads by the devotees during the entire day on the
                Samadhi. Then again, Chandan paste and attar are applied to the
                Samadhi. Rosewater is sprinkled, dhup is shown to the Samadhi,
                and the reading of the Quran begins. At the end of the ritual, a
                square piece of small white cloth is spread over the Samadhi,
                which is Baba's original coverlet (chaddar). Then all other
                spreads offered by the devotees are placed on top of the
                original white spread. Baba`s original white cloth on his Mazar
                teaches us, that even though Gurukrupa ashirwad may seem tiny as
                this white cloth, it holds significant importance to our souls.
                If we possess Krupa ashirwad in our hearts, then all future
                happiness will spread like these lavish substantial spreads on
                Baba's Mazar. The forthcoming sorrows will be cleared away along
                with the joy, just like in the Khidmat ritual. Eventually, what
                is left behind is the pure Krupa ashirwad and love. This is the
                foundation to establish Gurumarg.

                During the Siddhanta of Tarak mantra, on Malang Baba's urus day,
                Shri Haji Baba took a solemn vow from the 7 sevaks and warned
                them that this Sankalp must remain a secret and should not be
                discussed outside. However, as soon as Shri Haji Baba left, none
                of the seven sevaks had any memory of this Sankalp. It had
                completely erased from their mind. This was Shri Guru's
                remarkable mystical way. Our only prayer to this loving and
                superior Vibhuti should be that we carry out Shri Dadas and all
                Divya Punya Vibhutis mission with compassion and love as
                expected by them.

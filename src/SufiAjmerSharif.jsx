                P.P. Haji-Sheik Moinuddin Chisti, all the more prominently known
                as Khwaja Garib Nawaz, and Ajmer Sharif ( the supporter of poor
                people).

                He was quite possibly the most significant of the five vibhutis
                to contribute his ground-breaking direction to Dada in this
                Gurumarg. Initially known as Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, meaning
                the saviour of trust, he was born in Sistan and raised in
                Khorasan, Iran. He was an immediate relative of Prophet Hazrat
                Muhammad Pegambar's parentage, which means they had a similar
                genealogy. And P.P Muhammad Jilani was Moinuddin's maternal
                uncle (mamaji). Directly from his youth, he got massive bliss in
                assisting the poor and giving food. He was an image of devotion,
                amicability and harmony. He spent his whole time on earth
                lecturing love for every single living being and communal
                harmony. He saw a similar fire consuming in Dada to help
                humanity, and accordingly leaped to help him in this mission.

                Khwaja Garib Nawaz's family was wealthy; however, he lost his
                mom at age eight and his dad at 15. He was left with a little
                segment of land in the appropriation of his family property. He
                sold his property and gave all his abundance to poor people, and
                looked for profound information. Later he got Guruagnya
                (directions from his master) to set up his central goal and keep
                lecturing in Ajmer, India. He took a profound interest in
                Iterejan Runanubandh and how he can help eradicate the agonies
                and torments that influenced his aficionado's lives. This is why
                Dada gave the responsibility of the devotee's Iterejan
                Runanubandha to Khwaja Garib Nawaz.
                <br />
                In this mission, Ajmer Sharif instructed Dada to visit Pant
                Maharaj Balekundri. With Pant Maharaj’s instructions, Dada gave
                distinctive tunes to all the aartis composed by Pant Maharaj in
                "Shri Duttapremlehari, which had Shabdbrahma and Naadbrahma.
                Khwaja Garib Nawaz consistently realized that music is the most
                impressive medium to associate with God. With and Khwaja Garib
                Nawaz's direction and under Pant Maharaj's Shabdabrahma, Dada
                accomplished an enormous part in the achievement of this
                mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a consolidated longing of all the Vibhutis that Dada
                should have his own Vastu (a sacrosanct spot) for this mission.
                They had even chosen the name "Dwarka Mai" and had communicated
                their desire during their few Mulakhats (appearances) through
                Dada's medium. In any case, Dada's wellbeing was disintegrating,
                and without monetary assistance, this would not have been
                conceivable.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a unique custom to put a cloak behind Dada at whatever
                point Ajmer Sharif Baba came into Sanchar Avastha through Dada's
                medium. During one of such Mulakhat by Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti,
                he clarified the significance of raising this Vastu. He spread
                his cloak before all the devotees and asked for financial aid, a
                credit to help construct "Dwarka Mai." Baba much further
                guaranteed to restore the acquired money to all the devotees.
                With this gift and the entirety of the Vibhuti's guidance; The
                Holy sanctuary of Dwarka Mai was raised. Even after this
                development, there was no limit to troubles looked at by Dada
                and the Vibhutis. They struggled in benefiting from the
                fulfillment testament from the region. Khawja Garib Nawaz showed
                up in Sanchar Avastha, and the devotees set the cloak behind
                Dada. Then, the problem was cleared instantly. Is all the more
                astonishing that through all these troublesome occasions, Dada
                paid back all the devotees very quickly. Besides, these
                enthusiasts who had expanded their assistance with a gift for
                this Vastu were honoured by Khwaja Garib Nawaz himself to have
                their own Vastu (home) today. Just Khwaja Saheb himself had this
                incredible Ashirwad for all Vastus – this was his strength. This
                is the reason Dada consistently considered "DwarkaMai" as the
                property of the Vibhutis and not his own.
              </p>
              <p>
                Khwaja Garib Nawaz is a symbol of compassion, service and solid
                love. Decisively, this is the means by which Khwaja Garib Nawaz
                assumed a key role in Gurumarg.

              <p>
                Sikri was a small town and used to be the capital of the
                Rajputs. In 1526, Mughal Badshah Babar fought a war against
                Bahlul Khan Lodi, Rajput King Rana Sanga. At the end of the war,
                Babar became victorious. He considered this victory as the
                blessings from the Almighty and named the village 'Fateh', which
                means success, and then later, this town became well-known as
                Fatehpur Sikri. This town received further recognition as the
                home of Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chisti Rehemtulla Aleh. Shri
                Salim Chisti belonged to the 9th generation of Hazrat Baba Farid
                Ganj Shakar.

                Born and brought up in Fatehpur Sikri, Haji Hazrat Salim Sheikh
                Chisti was a supreme Sufi who supported Dada to accomplish the
                almighty's mission. Salim Chisti decided to leave his family at
                a very young age in search of the ultimate truth â€“ spiritual
                knowledge.

                Salim Chisti Baba was well known for performing wonders and
                fulfilling his devotees who desired to have a child. There are
                many stories and marvels where his devotees have been blessed
                with miraculous conception after praying (doing mannat) to Salim
                Chisti Baba and tying a thread at the marble windows of his
                Dargah. Once the wishes were fulfilled, the devotees would then
                come back to the Dargah and untie one of the threads tied on the
                window.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Mujhavar narrated one such story at his Dargah. A visitor from
                Africa had come to Fatehpur Sikri with his wife. This couple had
                no children. He had heard about this ritual of making a wish and
                tying a thread at the Dargah and that by offering prayers at
                Baba's Mazaar, all desires are fulfilled. This gentleman was
                quite aged, so out of curiosity, he asked the Mujawar
                humorously: "If I tie a thread and make a wish to Baba, do you
                think I can become a father even at this age". Mujh Havar said
                with full faith and confidence", Nothing is impossible in Baba's
                dargah". The gentleman tied a thread and made a wish, and he
                soon became the proud father of a son.

                Salim Baba left for Sirhind after a son was born to his elder
                brother. In Sirhind, he gained vast knowledge of various
                religious aspects. This is where he discovered his inner self
                (Atma Gyan). He then travelled to Bairoli to visit the tomb of
                Makdum Jainul Aave Din Chisti. He went to Mecca-Medina,
                Khorasan, Syria and stayed with many great Vibhuti saints where
                he gained further spiritual knowledge. During this journey, he
                met Sheikh Ibrahim Chisti, who later became Salim Baba's Guru
                and took Diksha. His Guru expressed his desire that Salim Baba
                should carry forward Sufi pant Chisti tradition and presented
                him with his robe as per the Sufi custom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some devotees had the opportunity to visit Salim Baba's dargah
                in Fatehpur Sikri. When the devotees met him, he affectionately
                enquired about their whereabouts, travel, and reason for their
                visit. When the devotees told him that they were Shri Dada's
                followers and had come for Salim Baba's darshan, he said, "You
                have come from a big city like Mumbai, spending your own money
                and without any guidance. You have taken the trouble of
                travelling this far, which only shows your love for Salim Baba.
                Love holds the highest (avastha) stage for unity in this world.
                Your esteemed Guru is worthy of immense praise for his efforts
                in establishing this love in everyone's heart without
                discriminating between religions, castes or sub-castes for world
                peace and humanity. It is an honour that your devotees have
                taken the responsibility of carrying forward your Guru's mission
                and doing his divine work". All the other Vibhutis also had only
                Love as their goal in their mission. Almighty's work can be
                carried out by only one individual; nothing is impossible.
                Muhammad Paigambar, Jesus Christ or Lord Buddha were all alone,
                and their only mission was to ignite love in everyone's heart.

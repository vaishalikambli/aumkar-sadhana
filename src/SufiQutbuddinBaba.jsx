              <p>
                The arrival of this powerful Sufi Vibhuti in Shri Dada's Karya
                was an extraordinary destiny. After the completion of
                Karmavimochan, the Dosh (defects) of the karmas were blocked for
                all the devotees, and their unfavourable karmas became
                favourable. Under Qutbuddin Baba's guidance, Shri Dada attained
                the 'Karmaadhin' avastha for all the devotees, which was
                necessary to eventually evolve into 'Sevak' avastha. Qutbuddin
                Baba had appeared in Sanchar avastha through Dada's medium when
                Dada had visited his Dargah in Delhi. He said in a stern tone,
                "I have come here to meet you all and tell you that from now
                onwards, you will live by Dharma and not by Karma. If you still
                wish to complain about karmas, then drown yourself in the river
                Jamuna". Such was this powerful Sufi Vibhuti who had spent his
                entire life doing almighty`s work with total faith and
                sincerity.

                Khwaja was born in a village called Osh in Iraq. During his
                lifetime, he was popularly known as Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki.
                His name has an essence of spirituality where Qutbuddin means
                Dhruvtara, which means the one who is loyal to his Guru, a
                powerful saint and a great leader who blazes a trail for others
                to follow. Bakhtiyar means the lucky one, and this title was
                given by his Guru Moinuddin Chisti of Ajmer (Gariban Nawaz).
                Khwaja was so fortunate to receive his Gurus Angarkha (attire),
                Guru's padukas (footwear) and Guru's Shirpech (headgear like a
                cap) while his Guru was still alive. Khwaja followed every
                instruction in the Gurukarya and lived up to the name given by
                his Shri Sadguru. The name Kaki was given by his devotees due to
                the following incidence:
              </p>
              <p>
                KhwajaSaheb used to buy his groceries from a nearby store on a
                credit basis. He had warned the store owner to keep track of his
                expenses and not allow credit exceeding 30 Dirhams. Khwaja Sahib
                used the Dakshina money that was left behind for the Fakir by
                the devotees to pay off his loan to the store owner. He had
                requested the owner not to allow any further credits until all
                the money owed to him was paid off. One fine day, Khwaja Saheb
                simply stopped taking any loans from the store owner. From that
                day, Rotis began to appear miraculously from beneath his aasan
                whenever they needed. This way, Khwaja was able to feed his
                family and did not need any loan. The store owner grew concerned
                that Khwaja must be angry with him, so he sent his wife to
                Khawja's house to determine why Khwaja had stopped taking loans.
                Khwaja's wife told her about the miracle Roti appearing from the
                aasan. However, as soon as this secret out, the miracles had
                stopped. Then Qutbuddin's Guru Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti
                instructed his disciples to give a loan up to 500 dirhams
                collectively to help Khwaja with his day-to-day living.
                Eventually, when Qutbuddin's spiritual level had reached its
                peak, he had stopped taking any kind of loans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Khwaja Qutbuddin's spirituality was of such a high class that
                all the great leaders and the saints in the Chisti order saluted
                his status with immense respect. Qutbudin Baba was born at
                midnight. At the time of his birth, his mother heard a divine
                voice, "This bright light that you see is the effect of the
                divine power that is injected into your son's soul by the
                Almighty. Always keep this in mind and conceal this secret about
                your son". Keeping this in mind, Khwaja's mother raised her son.
                She read the Quran so regularly that she had it memorized
                thoroughly. Khwaja's father had passed away when he was one and
                a half years old. When Khwaja was just four and a half years
                old, his mother decided to give him a primary education in the
                Quran. Khwaja got his primary education in Quran from Qazi
                Hamiduddin Nagauri. Later sometime Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti
                (Garib Nawaz) arrived in their village Osh in Iraq when
                Qutbuddin's mother took this excellent opportunity to meet the
                Khwaja and requested him to teach her son about the Quran.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such was this enormously powerful Sufi Vibhuti whose every
                action and massive effort was clearly outlined to establish
                Manavta Dharma (humanity) and initiate world peace. We,
                devotees, are extremely fortunate for Qubuddin Baba's
                contribution, guidance and support in Shri Dada's Karya. Baba
                not only gifted us with Karan Diksha but also further ensured
                that we attained Sevak avastha. Baba said, 'Giving Karan Diksha
                to all the souls that are in the Parlokas is extremely
                important. By giving Karan Diksha to one-quarter of human beings
                on earth (Ihalok) and three-quarters of souls in the Parlokas
                will make it possible to bring about noticeable changes in
                Acchar-Vicchar-Ucchar on the earth'.
              </p>
              <p>
                One evening a few devotees gathered and sat around Shri Dada
                when he requested the devotees sitting in front of him to get up
                and sit on his sides instead. This made the space in front of
                him vacant. Shri Dada then said, "There are several souls in
                front of us desperately waiting for Karan diskha. We have to
                give them this Diksha today." As soon as Shri Dada said this,
                the whole atmosphere changed suddenly from a very casual
                conversation into a thundering and intense situation and a
                powerful greeting-'Salam Alekum' echoed. Qutbuddin Baba had
                appeared in Sanchar Avasta through ShriDada's medium. At this
                time, Shri Dada had a brilliant shine on his face and the
                devotees were unbearable to look at his astounding powerful
                glow. But Dada held the devotee's hands and stared directly into
                them. Qutbuddin Baba instructed the devotees of what actions
                they required to perform. After the regular sadhana, Baba said,
                "I have come in a possessed state of Maha Kaaran avastha.
                Whatever was necessary to give I have given it to you devotees.
                I will leave behind this avastha and come back." Later as
                mentioned, he got rid of the Maha Kaaran avashta and came back
                in Sanchar Avasta in a much milder version and the devotees were
                able to look at Dada's face this time. It was a first time
                experience for all the present devotees to see how incredibly
                powerful Maha Kaaran avastha was.Then Baba said, "Today it is
                of utmost importance to give Karan Diksha to all the souls in
                the Parlokas. When these souls will take birth, at that time,
                only because of Kaaran Diskha they will become aware of the
                purpose of their life right from the moment they are born. Your
                Guru's efforts in this mission to obtain Karan Diksha for the
                souls in the Parlokas is highly commendable." Qutbuddin Baba's
                discussion on Karan Diksha was highly enlightening. Baba
                clarified how simple it was to give Karan Diksha to those souls
                in the Parlokas who are no longer attached to any religion,
                caste or physical body as compared to those living on earth in a
                physical body attached to a religion.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the devotees who were present received Kaaran Diksha from
                Shri Dada. At this time several Mulakhats on the importance of
                Karan Diksha were conducted. On one such occasion, right in the
                midst of the seminar Vandaniya Dada suddenly started singing
                'Jai Jai Ram Krishna Hari'. Sant Tukaram had appeared in Sanchar
                Avastha through Shri Dada's medium and introduced himself,"I am
                Tukarambua; your Guru has taken a very great responsibility for
                this mission. You are all so very fortunate to be blessed by
                such a powerful Guru's presence. I have a very humble request to
                make to you all. Kindly request your Guru to grant Karan Diksha
                to our Varkari devotees as well." (Varkari are those devotees
                who go on their annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur on foot. The vow
                is known as Vari or trip and the devotees are Varkaris). When
                the devotees narrated the whole incident to Shri Dada, he
                requested them to offer Bida, supari, an unshelled coconut and 1
                and quarter rupees in the temple. The following day, Khwaja
                Qutbuddin Baba appeared in Sanchar avastha and instructed the
                sewaks to visit Shri Sant Gyaneshwar Samadhi in Alandi and offer
                the above Bida after first taking the blessings from Pant
                Maharaj in Balekundri and Shri Sainath Maharaj in Dwarkamai
                Pune. Finally, they received the confirmation that Karan Diksha
                will be given to all Varkaris as well. The greatest mission of
                defining Janmakaran to all human beings was achieved by going
                beyond one's religion. The architect and the creator of this
                work was Khwaja Hazrat Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, one more very important contribution made by Qutbuddin
                Baba in this mission was the funeral prayer for the departed
                souls. He mentioned that because of Karan Diksha and with Guru
                Krupa these souls easily attain the higher level of lokas. These
                souls do not need any other funeral rites. <strong>Once a devotee is
                accepted in his Guru's Jholi, the rest of the journey is fully
                secured and taken care of by Shri Guru.</strong> In order to ensure a
                good appropriate next birth, it is very important to conduct the
                funeral rites. Focusing on this point Shri Qutbuddin Baba said,
                when these last rituals are performed for the deceased person,
                only then that soul can get a useful life in the next birth.
                There is no exception for funeral rites. Today there is a
                scarcity of priests who have the ability to conduct the funeral
                rites correctly. This is why, when Qutbuddin Baba once came in
                sancharavastha through Shri Dada's medium he composed and
                recited the funeral prayer in his divine voice. He instructed
                all the devotees to say this funeral prayer on the 12th day
                after all the funeral rituals are completed. He further
                instructed that one must place Rs 150/- at the temple altar and
                later send the same to Shri kshetra Balekundri for annadaan
                (food donation). Thus, with a straightforward funeral prayer and
                an inexpensive /effortless ritual of annadaan, Qutbuddin baba
                simplified the funeral rites for us all devotees.
              </p>
              <p>
                These powerful Sufi Vibhutis from time to time explained the
                importance of the mission and guided the devotees through Dada's
                medium when conducting Sadhana Samelan. In one such seminar,
                Qutbuddin Baba had given such a powerful and highly effective
                speech that all the devotees clearly understood the importance
                of our journey from a small puddle of karma towards the
                magnificent ocean of Dharma. His every word pierced through
                every devotee's soul who were present then and left a permanent
                impression. He mentioned how selfish, self-centred many bhaktas
                are, those who come for kaamkaaj and then easily forget their
                Guru once they have achieved what they asked for. But a common
                man is unaware of what actually he has benefited from his Guru
                at this time. They have no idea or understanding of the divine
                shelter in Vibhutis jholi that is provided by our Guru. He
                further explained what Guru's shelter means and how Vibhutis
                take the responsibility of taking complete care of their
                devotee's life. A life that is born in accordance to its Karmas,
                the materialistic attractions are so powerful that it is almost
                impossible to be detached from its clutches. Only Guru Krupa and
                strong devotional prayers can help a human being to break free
                from such forces. If ego (self-pride) is uprooted and erased due
                to Guru Krupa then the one who lives his life to the fullest by
                surrendering totally, submitting all his joys and sorrows at his
                Guru's feet with complete gratitude and high regards towards the
                Almighty is definitely the one to benefit the Gurukrupaashirwad.
                This is usually almost impossible for any common man. Manav
                Jeevan (human life) is 25% on Ihalok (on earth) and 75% in
                Parlok (where Earthbound spirits reside). Qutbuddin Baba gave a
                great explanation on this through Mulakhat.
              </p>
              <p>
                We human beings have the tendency to run after destructions and
                calamities in life. It is now high time we devotees become
                stronger and determined for the benefit of mankind. Human Beings
                have always accused Karma for their ill fate when praying to the
                Almighty. What one must ask for in their prayers and how one
                must now live <strong>in accordance with Dharma instead of Karma</strong> after
                receiving the Guru Krupa Ashirwad has been explained by Baba.
                Qutbuddin Baba repeatedly highlighted the message on how we
                devotees must live our life in accordance to Dharma with Guru
                Krupa Ashirwad.

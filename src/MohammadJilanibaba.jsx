                Shri Haji Hazarat Muhammad Jilanee Baba of Baghdad
              </h4>
              <p>
                2500 years ago, Shri Nathas had anticipated the catastrophe on
                this earth in the period of Kaliyug. Shri Nathas started a
                mission as the means to save this beautiful world created by
                Brahmadev. Shri Gurudada re-established this mission and with
                Shri Jagatguru Sainath Maharaj's Krupa-ashirwad, Shri
                Shaktipeeth was established in Goa on Gudi Padwa day. This was
                the beginning of the main purpose of world peace and human
                welfare. In order to raise this victory banner, Shri Dada
                received support from several Vibhutis in this mission. Among
                the powerful Sufi Vibhutis, Param Pujya Muhammad Jilanee Baba
                was a pioneer in this mission. His guidance and contribution
                were invaluable. Baba`s dargah is situated in Baghdad, Iraq.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jilanee Baba was born in the Gilan province of Iran on the first
                day of Ramadan. Jilanee means "Luminous." Baba was well known
                for his vivid devotion to matru pitru (parents), his intense
                love for the Almighty and his creations. This radiant Vibhuti
                was also the maternal uncle of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti of Ajmer.
                When Jilanee Baba was born, his mother was sixty years of age.
                Baba spent thirty-six years of his initial life as a teacher and
                as a peacekeeper. The later forty years were spent in giving
                spiritual guidance to the general public. He was extremely
                devoted and truthful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Muhammad Jilanee Baba had set up his mission for social welfare
                in Baghdad, because of which right from a common man to
                designated spiritual saints approached Baba for guidance and
                counselling. His teachings were focused on truthfulness,
                authenticity and kindness to Itarejan (others) rather than
                importance to rituals and actions; and that God-realization is
                through perfect <strong>aachar-vichar</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>ucchar</strong> by being honest, genuine and treating
                Itarejan with love. Jilanee Baba had gained the title of
                "Gousul" which was achievable only by high-level priests.
                Jilanee Baba had spent 25 years alone in the forest in Iraq, in
                order to achieve oneness with God. He spent innumerable
                sleepless nights alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jilanee Baba has often been referred to as the 'Rose' of
                Baghdad. This is illustrated in the story below. A Rose is
                considered to be a representation of the meditative composure by
                many Sufi Vibhutis. In his era, there was an abundance of Sufi
                Vibhutis in the town of Baghdad where Jilanee Baba lived. When
                Jilanee Baba arrived at the border of Baghdad, the native
                Vibhutis sent him an urn filled with water up to the brim;
                implying that the city of Baghdad had an excess of Sufi Vibhutis
                just like the brimming water in the jug and there was no space
                for even a single more drop of water. It was wintertime and the
                season for roses had ended. Yet, Jilanee Baba produced a fully
                bloomed Rose using his spiritual power and placed it carefully
                on the brimming water in the jug sending back a clear message to
                all the Sufis of Baghdad that he can still secure his place in
                Baghdad. They not only got his message but also realized his
                spiritual power and greatness. They were all overjoyed and went
                to the border of the city to welcome him and said, "Jilanee Baba
                is our Rose and our spiritual mentor of the highest level."
                Since then the Rose became a holy symbol of the Qadiri Sufi
                order which is considered as an icon of the Prophet. This is why
                all the disciples and the followers in Qadiri order stick a rose
                into their cap.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thousands of devotees came to visit Jilanee Baba. Baba would
                distribute all the donations offered by his devotees. He would
                give away some portion of the donations to the vendors who
                provided him with his daily bread and other groceries. Baba
                would always say, "Always respect the one who provides your
                daily bread because food is none other than Parabrahma. Your
                soul remains calm and content when your hunger is satisfied.
                This gives you the energy to perform prayers and to do the
                Seva." Every afternoon the shopkeeper would come to deliver four
                Rotis to Baba. Baba would break the bread into several pieces
                and distribute them among the crowded devotees and then he would
                eat the remaining piece.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at the sufferings on this earth, Param Pujya Jilanee
                Baba became distressed even in his dargah after leaving his
                physical body. After several years when an incomparable soul in
                the purest form was found in Shri Guru Dada, with Almighty's
                directions Jilanee Baba descended down to support and guide Dada
                in his selfless mission for the well-being of others. Highly
                committed to the Almighty, extremely disciplined and very
                affectionate Vibhuti, ParamPujya Muhammad Jilanee Baba appeared
                for the first time in Audumbar where Vandaniya Dada resided.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Vandaniya Dada was recruited into the military, he had the
                opportunity to visit Param Pujya Muhammad Jilanee Baba's Samadhi
                when in Iraq. Baba guided Sri Guru Dada in this mission and
                taught complex subject matters on Vanshvimochan and
                Karmavimochan. When Shri Sai Adhyatmic Samiti was established,
                in order to manage the mission flawlessly, Jilanee Baba appeared
                in Sanchar avastha for preaching and guidance regularly for
                almost four years. Previously when Shri Haji Malang Baba would
                appear in trance through Dada's medium there were no fixed
                timings for counselling (Kamkaj). Devotees would pour in at any
                time as per their own convenience and Shri Guru Dada never
                refused them. However, due to this in-disciplinary action,
                Vandaniya Dada had to suffer a lot and had to miss his meals
                many times. In order to curb such indefinite timings P.P.
                Jilanee Baba determined a fixed scheduled time for kamkaj.
                Jilanee Baba appeared in Sanchar avastha and finalized the
                Kamkaj days and timings.
              </p>
              <p>
                P.P.Jilanee Baba created the new rules on the requirements for
                kamkaj - to bring along a coconut, two paan leaves, one supari,
                and one and quarter rupee and to be present at the center half
                an hour before the aarti. Baba explained all the rules in detail
                to all the devotees - The purpose of being present at the center
                half an hour before the aarti is to get rid of one’s Dushit
                Valay (contaminated aura). Therefore the foul ring around you
                gets dissolved and is replaced by the Daivi Valay
                (celestial/pure aura) which exists in the center. By being
                present for the aarti, you have already received half the kamkaj
                due to the cosmic vibrations in the aarti. Further, the two
                <strong>paanbida</strong> means Iha-janm (present birth) and
                Gata-janma (previous birth), the <strong>supari</strong> means
                your own representation and the <strong>money</strong> on the
                Bida means your Karmas. In addition, when you register your name
                and address for the kamkaj, at that time you are actually
                surrendering all the defects associated with your family,
                ancestors of your seven generations by uttering your full family
                name; and the defects associated with your Vastu(home) by giving
                out your full address at the feet of ShriSai Baba. Along with
                the paan-Bida, supari Dakshina you also bring a coconut; this
                coconut is the only fruit that bears all the five elements of
                Panchamahabhuta Tatwa (the five elements). This is why it is
                called Srifal. The human body also possesses these five elements
                because of which our defects easily flow into the coconut as
                soon as you hold it in your hand. Ultimately, all the bodily
                defects along with Vanshdosh, Karmadosh and Vastudosh are left
                at Baba's feet and you go home charged with Krupa Ashirwad.
              </p>
              <p>
                Param Pujya Jilanee Baba also introduced Samvedana Shastra (the
                science of healing) in this mission. He incorporated all three
                -Sparsh Samvedana (touch), Gyan Samvedana (knowledge) and Vichar
                Samvedana (opinions) in this mission. He appointed and trained
                the Sewaks on how to prepare the Abhimantrit Goli, Oil and Tirth
                by chanting the selected mantras from Rig Vedas. Eventually,
                Vandaniya Dada simplified the ritual to provide samvedna by
                simply chanting Shri Satguru namasmaran which had the same
                effect as the mantras in Rig Vedas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Param Pujya Jilanee Baba also started a new scheme of small
                savings in the mission. He instructed all the devotees to
                deposit one and quarter rupee at the center for every meal that
                was eaten at other people’s house or ceremonies (श्राध्द
                shraadh, marriage, naming ceremony, threading ceremony). When
                enough money was collected it was donated to any institute that
                needed help to run their welfare services. This way Baba showed
                a simple method of removing the defects in the food. Later this
                accomplishment was added in Shri Sai Swadhyay Mandal's treasure
                by Shri Jagadguru Sainath Maharaj. The amazing thing about this
                is that the one who receives the donation or help will have no
                trace of the donor. This way the defects created by the wealth
                earned are not passed on to the devotee.
              </p>
              <p>
                P.P.Jilanee Baba showed how spiritual progress became possible
                by following the disciplined diet time-table through Aahar
                Shastra (the science of nutritious diet). Baba suggested a daily
                meal plan taking into account everyone's likes and dislikes in
                order to bring discipline and restrictions in the diet;
                eventually replacing vasana in our Annamaykosh with that of
                Ishwari element. He made sure that everyone's favourite recipe
                was included in the week's time-table in such a way that each
                member of the family could enjoy their favourite meal at least
                once a week.
              </p>
              <p>
                VimochanShastra (the science of liberation) was P.P. Jilanee
                Baba's mastery. Baba suggested five-week of Puja Prasad for
                removal of the deficiency and irregularity that developed in
                Vanshdosh, Karmadosh, Kuladharma, Kulachaar, Kulopasana,
                Kuladevata, Gramdevata, Vastudevta, Vastudosh, thread ceremony,
                utilization of homeland and Black-magic effects. Every Prasad
                and Puja vidhi that was suggested by Jilanee Baba only proved
                his profound knowledge and deep-rooted study about our human
                life and related sorrows. He further outlined the rules,
                practices and responsibilities for not only the Sewaks but also
                for the devotees who come to the center. There are a total of 27
                instructions in the rule book and if these are memorized or
                remembered every day then you will see definite stability in
                your <strong>achaar-vichar-uchaar</strong>, transforming our human life into
                Ishwarmay (celestial). P.P.Jilanee Baba had a fascinating way of
                combining celestial principles and earthly actions when
                delivering Mulaqats. The most important contribution in
                ShriDada's mission made by P.P.Jilani Baba was his tremendous
                guidance in pervasive Karmavimochan and Runamochan. Therefore
                after the Karmavimochan and Runamochan of the devotees, their
                <strong>JanmaKarma runanubandh</strong> responsibility was given to P.P.Jilani
                Baba by Shri Guru Dada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Param Pujya Jilanee Baba passed away at the age of 91. He had
                spent his entire life spreading the devotion of the everlasting
                God and doing the welfare of mankind. Such was P.P.Muhammad
                Jilanee Baba who descended from the highest level of Saptlokas
                down to the earth, immersed himself in the welfare of mankind,
                driving away common man's sorrows and making tedious efforts to
                transform human life into celestial being. In short, he can be
                described as a blazing reflection of Duty, Faith, Love and
                patience.
